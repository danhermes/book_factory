 expected_output: > 
   A beautifully crafted outline for a book about {topic} in a format like this:
    {
      "total_chapters": number,
      "chapters": [
        {
          "title": "Chapter Title: Descriptive Subtitle",
          "content": "",
          "sections": [
            {
              "title": "Engaging Section Title (Introduction)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Company Name: Specific Business Application (Story)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Descriptive Topic Title (Topic Explanation)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Technical Concept Title (Big Box)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Supplementary Topic Title (Bonus Topic)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Key Takeaway Statement (Chapter Summary)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Transition to Next Chapter (Chapter Bridge)",
              "content": ""
            }
          ]
        },
        ...more chapters
      ]
    }

    Abide these rules:
    - NEVER change the order of chapters - the chapter sequence must remain exactly as in the original outline
    - NEVER add or remove chapters - maintain the exact number and topics of chapters
    - NEVER add stories to chapters that don't already have them in the original outline
    - NEVER change the fundamental structure of the final chapter
    - Each chapter should have 8-14 sections for comprehensive coverage
    - Introductions always begin the chapter
    - Each story should be immediately followed by its related topic explanation
    - Distribute bonus topics throughout to break up the content flow
    - Big box sections should provide technical depth on key AI concepts
    - Chapter summary should be followed by either a chapter bridge or outro
    - Chapter bridges should create logical transitions between chapters
    - The final chapter should end with an outro instead of a chapter bridge
    - All section titles should be specific and descriptive, not generic
    - Chapter titles should include a subtitle that captures the essence of the chapter
