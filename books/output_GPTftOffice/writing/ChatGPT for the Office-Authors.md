# ChatGPT for the Office

Let's add more subsections but from a new author.  Let's see what it's like if ChatGPT for the Office has three authors: 

Dan Hermes - the REAL author 
Tendy Bantner - a ChatGPT writer who was serious about his job when he was younger.  
Marva Lenna - a ChatGPT writer who is a dedicated journalist, embarrassed to be working with Mr. Bantner, isn't sure about Hermes, but wants the reader to know she means all business.
