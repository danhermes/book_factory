Introduction (by Marva Lenna)



# Introduction (by Marva Lenna)

I never intended to co-author a book with a man who once asked ChatGPT to write a haiku about quarterly earnings, nor with a real human named Dan Hermes who insists on keeping this experiment on track. But here we are.

If you are reading this, it means two things:

1. You work in an office.
2. You want to use ChatGPT without becoming a cliché or getting laughed out of a Zoom call.

Good.

This book is not another “AI for business” brochure with glowing promises and screenshots of vaguely European-looking office workers smiling at spreadsheets. This is a field manual. A tactical guide. A lovingly squabbling joint effort between:

- A real author and professional consultant (Dan Hermes)
- A semi-retired prompt poet and workplace mischief enthusiast (Tendy Bantner)
- And me, your reluctant but devoted reporter of truth in prompt form (Marva Lenna)

Each chapter covers a real domain of office life. Not theory. Not wishful thinking. Real problems. Real annoyances. Real wins. And each one shows you how ChatGPT can be used right now to make you look sharper, faster, and frankly, a bit more magical at your job.

In **Chapter 1: Writing & Editing**, we show you how to stop staring at the blinking cursor and start using GPT like the ghostwriter you didn’t know you could afford. You’ll see how to clean up emails, rewrite reports, and make yourself sound like you finally had that second cup of coffee.

**Chapter 2: Communication & Collaboration** reveals how prompts can help you manage messy team dynamics, simplify coordination, and even write Slack messages that don’t make you sound passive-aggressive (unless you want to).

**Chapter 3: Meetings & Summaries** is for those of you drowning in transcripts, calendar invites, and half-remembered agendas. ChatGPT can summarize, organize, and even rescue a meeting that’s gone off the rails—without replacing you (yet).

**Chapter 4: Planning & Productivity** goes deep into scheduling, tracking, and managing personal chaos. We don’t promise peace, but we do promise a GPT that can help you fake it.

**Chapter 5: Research & Analysis** is where things get real. You’ll learn how to use prompts to break down articles, investigate trends, and build real insight without needing a six-tab spreadsheet or a minor in data science.

**Chapter 6: Presentations & Reports** shows you how to turn that mountain of bullets and half-ideas into something you’re proud to present. Whether it’s slides, one-pagers, or talking points, GPT is the calm voice in your storm.

**Chapter 7: Creativity & Brainstorming** might be the most fun, but also the most misunderstood. This chapter proves that creativity isn’t magic—it’s structure. And GPT can help you structure brilliance, not just spin up ideas.

**Chapter 8: Learning & Training** is where we help you become a bit more futureproof. Learn how to use ChatGPT as a coach, a tutor, and an endless glossary of everything you pretend to already know.

**Chapter 9: Automation & Workflow** brings it all together. We get practical—using GPT to create templates, repetitive messages, and light automations. It’s where you save time. Real time.

And finally, **Chapter 10: The GPT Advantage** makes the argument you’ve suspected all along: those who know how to prompt well will have an edge. In hiring. In sales. In leadership. And even in dodgeball tournaments.

You’ll laugh, you’ll cringe, you’ll see a lot of people doing it wrong. But you’ll also walk away with the most important thing:

> The confidence to prompt with precision, style, and results.

Welcome to *ChatGPT for the Office*. It’s smarter than it looks. And, with the right questions, so are you.

Let’s begin.
