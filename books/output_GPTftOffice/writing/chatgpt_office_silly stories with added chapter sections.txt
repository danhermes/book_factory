Yes but use new chapter sections:  

- Promptitude: a flip section of useful discussion of a few of the stories prompts. And their wins.
- Funny Failure Stories - very brief anecdotes of people who prompt TERRIBLY and receive their just desserts.  Followed up by:
- Shame Recap - an alternately too serious and flip discussion of why those prompts sucked and what would have helped.
- Head to Head - Both AI-savvy, RazorBeam and DriftLoaf have prompting competitions.  And sometimes they cheat. 


# Chapter 1: Writing & Editing

## Razorbeam Dynamics: "The Ghost in the Quarterly Report"

Lauren was at her desk, one floor above a frenzied game of hallway bocce ball. Her coworkers, many in gym shorts, screamed about brackets. Lauren wasn’t screaming. She was drowning.

Stratonix Energy—Razorbeam’s largest client—was due a Q1 analytics report. Their CEO, Marjorie, had reviewed Lauren’s draft, scribbled cryptic notes like *"needs more punch but also polish"*, and then promptly disappeared to spar with her fencing coach on the roof.

Lauren blinked at the document. Blank.

She opened ChatGPT.

> **"Rewrite this executive summary for a quarterly energy analytics report. Tone: confident, polished, 3 stats upfront. Keep under 200 words."**

The bot returned something usable. Good, even. She pressed in:

> **"Add a strong closing line that implies partnership and value."**

Marjorie returned, winded but victorious. She read it, nodded, and said, "Perfect. I wish I knew who wrote this."

Stratonix renewed their contract that afternoon.

Lauren celebrated by locking her office door and whispering *thank you* to her laptop.

## DriftLoaf: "Snacktime, Slacktime, Deadline"

Sanjay had been ghostwriting apology emails to customers who found raisins in their salt boxes. Then the Slack ping hit:

> *“Need a case study for Growswell—tight, upbeat, ROI-focused. 2pm.”*

It was 11:40. His lunch was still frozen. His soul, too.

He opened ChatGPT:

> **"Write a one-page case study for a retail client using a snack box subscription. Tone: human, positive, include real ROI metrics."**

Then:

> **"Use this quote: 'The biggest win was how our staff actually looked forward to Mondays.'"**

> **"Add 3-bullet summary up top."**

He sent it by 1:42. The sales team copied it into three pitches. By Friday, two demos were booked.

His burrito was cold, but his inbox was hot.

## Promptitude (by Tendy Bantner): Breakdown of Prompt Wins

**Lauren's Prompts:**

* Requested *clear format, tone, and structure* (stats + polish + brevity)
* Used specific follow-up: “Add a strong closing line…”
* Result: Avoided executive rewrite hell and locked down renewal

**Sanjay's Prompts:**

* Gave solid context (target audience, tone, actual client quote)
* Iterated: summary bullets + realism + tone check
* Result: Created usable marketing asset, landed real prospects

**Lesson:**

> Ask for what you want like you already believe it’s possible. GPT *wants* to help you win.

## Funny Failure Stories (compiled by Tendy Bantner)

* **Claire from Procurement:** “Write something good and fast and short about our thing.”

* **Result:** ChatGPT returned a haiku about optimization. Claire sent it to the board. They asked if she was having a stroke.

* **Don in Sales:** “Hey AI, make this better?” *\[no text attached]*

* **Result:** GPT apologized and generated a poem about donuts. Don read it out loud in the pitch. Silence.

---

## Shame Recap (dramatically rendered by Tendy Bantner)

* **Claire’s Mistake:** Vague inputs yield cosmic gibberish. “Our thing”? Define it. “Good”? Define that too. Use requests that include tone, target, and goal.
* **Don’s Error:** He sent nothing. GPT isn’t psychic (yet). Always include input text or context.

> **Remedy:** Just say: “Rewrite this email to sound urgent but friendly.” Or: “Summarize this and make it sound like it wasn’t written by an alien.”

## Head to Head: Razorbeam vs DriftLoaf (field notes by Tendy Bantner)

The rules were simple:
Each team was given a task—this week, write a convincing cold email to an exec—and 10 minutes.

Razorbeam used prompt chains:

* **Prompt 1:** “Summarize this deck in 3 value props.”
* **Prompt 2:** “Turn those into a persuasive email for a busy CMO.”

DriftLoaf? Less formal.

* **Prompt:** “Write an email that convinces a VP to buy our snack boxes. Include at least one food pun.”

GPT delivered for both.

**Judges declared a tie**—until it was revealed DriftLoaf had secretly trained a custom GPT on past winning email threads.

The Razorbeam CEO demanded a rematch. The DriftLoaf CEO passed out edible business cards in protest.

Next week’s challenge: Prompt a resignation letter that still gets you invited to the holiday party.

## Addendum: Clarity Over Cleverness (by Marva Lenna)

The above anecdotes are entertaining, but let’s remember the point: office writing is not a reality show. It is an act of coordination, persuasion, and professionalism. The prompts that worked? They were clear, scoped, and tied to real goals.

> GPT is a tool for executing intentions. If your intention is ambiguous, your result will be as well.

Lauren’s win came not from flair, but precision. Sanjay’s win came not from charm, but clarity.

If you want results, ask with specificity. Humor is garnish. Use it only when you know the main dish is solid.

## Field Journal: Real Prompts, Real Office Use (from the desk of Marva Lenna)

Here are three real prompts from professionals who actually needed to get their jobs done:

1. **"Rewrite this internal email to be more concise and sound less like I’m mad."**
2. **"Create an email subject line for an all-hands that won’t freak people out but still gets read."**
3. **"Summarize this attached memo in under 150 words and suggest 2 action items based on it."**

None of these made the leaderboard at DriftLoaf. But they all worked.

Let’s not confuse cleverness for effectiveness.

This is your office. Prompt like a grown-up.
