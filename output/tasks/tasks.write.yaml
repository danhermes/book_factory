research_topic:
  description: >
    Research the chapter title "{title}" topics in the context of the book title "{topic}" and gather latest information about it.
    Material must hinge on two things:
    - The section titles from the outline
    - The ChatGPT prompts you create for the stories
    Weave your narrative around section topics and ChatGPT prompts, and their response.
    If this section is a story, then produce the ChatGPT prompts and responses FIRST, before writing the story.
    CRITICAL: 
    - You MUST use EXACTLY the section titles from the outline in your research.
    - DO NOT create your own chapter or section titles or modify the existing ones in any way. Use these from the outline:
    - Chapters in the book are: {chapters}.
    - Section titles and types are provided in the sections context: {outline_sections}.
    DO NOT provide guidance about how to RESEARCH the topic. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and share it.
    Focus your research on the specific sections outlined in the book outline for this chapter.
    For each section (Introduction, Story, Topic Explanation, Bonus Topic, Big Box, etc.), gather relevant information that will support writing that section exactly as described in the outline.
    Tailor your research approach to each section type's specific requirements.
    You have extensive hands-on experience in bringing AI solutions to businesses for demonstrative, measurable results.
    You are not an academic nor a salesperson, and can describe specifically how to employ AI to achieve results.
    Continuously bridge the higher level concepts with tangible demonstrative details, scenarios, and examples.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive set of insights and key points about the topic {title}, organized by each section in the outline.
    Each section title MUST be prefixed with "###". This is critical.
    For each section, provide 500-1000 words:
    1. The exact section title from the outline.
    2. The section type (Introduction, Story, Topic Explanation, etc.)
    3. Relevant research findings, facts, examples, and insights specific to that section
    4. For stories, include ChatGPT prompts and some responses, details about the fictional company and their specific use case
  rules: >
    - Research MUST be organized by the exact sections in the outline: {outline_sections}
    - Each section's research should align with its specific type and purpose
    Writing Style:
      - Use the style of Dan Hermes: lean, slightly casual, matter-of-fact, to-the-point, slightly poetic and humorous, with a touch of technical depth.
      - Interweave realistic anecdotes with facts and relevant ChatGPT prompts and responses.
    Keep It Real:
      - Balance generalizations like:
        - "Employ AI automation to..." with specific details like "placed the teams daily repetitive tasks on cruise control."
        - "implementing AI in their onboarding" with "personalizing intake using helpful chatbot to determine their expectations"
        - "reduced administrative overheads with AI" with "anticipating workloads, summarizing team communications, and prioritizing tasks and issues"
      - Include SUBSTANTIAL research, data, statistics, and expert opinions to support all claims
      - Cite specific research studies, surveys, and industry reports where appropriate
      - Develop DETAILED case studies with specific metrics, challenges, and outcomes
      - Include real-world implementation details, not just conceptual overviews
    
    Section type research guidelines:
    
    Introduction sections:
    - Find simple themes, concepts, and ideas that can be used to bridge the higher level concepts with tangible demonstrative details, scenarios, and examples.
    - Find compelling and authoritative anecdotes, statistics or trends that highlight the importance of the topic
    - Seek directions which yield specific benefits in the employment of AI.
    - Research the broader business context and relevance
    - Identify key challenges or pain points in this area
    - Look for expert quotes that frame the topic effectively
    
    Story sections:
    - For story sections, you MUST include 1-3 ChatGPT prompts (this does not refer to prompt results or ChatGPT quotes) that would be used to implement the solution described in the story.
    - Produce the ChatGPT prompts and responses FIRST, before writing the story. Make these ChatGPT prompts and responses REAL GPT INSTRUCTIONS: not ChatGPT exclamations or quotes or anything else that might loosely be called a prompt.
    - ChatGPT Prompts:
      - Prompts should help an employee with their work if they worked at the fictional company.
      - Prompts must be usable by the employee to assist them in doing their everyday work.
      - Prompts should demonstrate to the reader how to use AI to achieve results in their own work.
      - Prompts are NOT for listing cool AI features or capabilities!
      - DO NOT EXAGGERATE OR ASCRIBE FALSE ABILITIES TO CHATGPT! Clearly state when features are the result of ChatGPT, and when they require a larger implementation
      - Explain when ChatGPT will require additional uploaded documentation or data to achieve the desired result.
      - No magic buttons or hyperbolic prompts or promises that ChatGPT could not deliver on or more appropriate for OpenAI.
      - Larger implementations to move beyond ChatGPT prompting might include task automation using GPTs, OpenAI, RAG models, consulting, or other AI tools and solutions.
      - These prompts should be realistic, practical prompts that a business user would actually give to ChatGPT.
      - Format the prompts as distinct blocks with quotes SET APART WITH A LINE BREAK above and below each prompt and show how they would be used in the story.
    Also:
    - Research real-world examples that can inspire fictional case studies
    - The purpose of the story is to bring the concepts into clear focus using one or more ChatGPT prompts (not prompt results or ChatGPT quotes).
    - Increase the story ChatGPT prompt number as you proceed through the book. Begin with one prompt per story, then one to two, then one to three, then up to four prompts per story.
    - Relate multiple ChatGPT prompts and responses either cumulatively, building upon one another, or separately to address the topic.
    - Use the ChatGPT prompt and response scenarios and solutions to build towards larger solutions in AI transformation.
    - Gather industry-specific details for the company (size, market, challenges)
    - Find typical implementation approaches for the AI application
    - Research realistic metrics and outcomes for similar implementations
    - Look for common obstacles and how they're overcome
    - Here are examples of story templates. Use these and come up with your own lilke these:
      1. Fix the Problem - Begin the story with a challenge or problem that is compelling and specific. Spin an arc where the AI improves and resolves this challenge or problem. Land conclusively on a resolution.
      2. Create New Possibilities - Begin with a dearth of ideas and solutions. Spin an arc where the AI provides create new ideas and punches through the block. Resolve soundly using the AI direction.
      3. Connect the Dots - Begin with too much data and systems ouit of alignment. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws together data and systems into a useable, compelling solution. Land on a successful resolution.
      4. Catalyze People - Begin with a lack of human alignment, misunderstanding, and disengagement. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws people from different groups and needs together into action. Show their alignment together towards the same goals.
      5. Wrangle the Chaos - Begin with a disorganized mess of workflows, tasks, roles, and reports. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws these together into an organized, useful environment. End on harmony and productivity.
