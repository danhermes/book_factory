    Reorganize, reorder, and enhance the existing outline for a book about ChatGPT for Business.
    Create a logical flow between chapters and ensure each chapter tells a cohesive story with properly paired sections.
    Add descriptive subtitles to chapter titles and make section titles more engaging and specific.
    
    CRITICAL: You MUST use the Reader Tool to directly access these RAG content files:
    1. Use "expanded_outline_chatgpt_for_business.txt" or "outline" to access the expanded outline
    2. Use "full_content_chatgpt_for_business.txt" or "full_content" to access the full content
    
    These files contain the specific case studies, themes, and structure that MUST be incorporated into your outline.
    For Chapter 1 (Customer Experience), extract all the stories (WelcomeWell, StackHaven, FlexTax, LeadFleet, BriteTeam)
    and create detailed sections for each one, along with the topic explanations and bonus topics.
    
    Your outline MUST include at least 8-12 detailed sections per chapter that directly reference the content from the RAG files.

  expected_output: >
    A beautifully crafted outline for a book about {topic} in the following format:
    {
      "total_chapters": number,
      "chapters": [
        {
          "title": "Chapter Title: Descriptive Subtitle",
          "content": "",
          "sections": [
            {
              "title": "Engaging Section Title (Introduction)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Company Name: Specific Business Application (Story)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Descriptive Topic Title (Topic Explanation)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Technical Concept Title (Big Box)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Supplementary Topic Title (Bonus Topic)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Key Takeaway Statement (Chapter Summary)",
              "content": ""
            },
            {
              "title": "Transition to Next Chapter (Chapter Bridge)",
              "content": ""
            }
          ]
        },
        ...more chapters
      ]
    }

    Abide these rules:
    - NEVER change the order of chapters - the chapter sequence must remain exactly as in the original outline
    - NEVER add or remove chapters - maintain the exact number and topics of chapters
    - NEVER add stories to chapters that don't already have them in the original outline
    - NEVER change the fundamental structure of the final chapter
    - Each chapter should have 8-14 sections for comprehensive coverage
    - Introductions always begin the chapter
    - Each story should be immediately followed by its related topic explanation
    - Distribute bonus topics throughout to break up the content flow
    - Big box sections should provide technical depth on key AI concepts
    - Chapter summary should be followed by either a chapter bridge or outro
    - Chapter bridges should create logical transitions between chapters
    - The final chapter should end with an outro instead of a chapter bridge
    - All section titles should be specific and descriptive, not generic
    - Chapter titles should include a subtitle that captures the essence of the chapter
