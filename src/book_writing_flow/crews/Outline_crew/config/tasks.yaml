    RAG files Outline and Chapter Content:
    - "book_outline" file to access the book outline below. This contains the exact book structure.
    - "chapter_content" file to access the chapter content below. This contains the chapter structure and content. (ex. prompts, stories, topics, workflows)    
    Your outline must exactly match the book_outline structure.
    Your outline MUST include at least 8-12 detailed sections per chapter of specified section types (below) that directly reference the chapter_content.
    These files contain the specific case studies, themes, and structure that MUST be incorporated into your outline.   

    Abide these rules:
    - NEVER change the order of chapters - the chapter sequence must remain exactly as in the original outline
    - NEVER add or remove chapters - maintain the exact number and topics of chapters
    - NEVER add stories to chapters that don't already have them in the original outline
    - NEVER change the fundamental structure of the final chapter
    - Each chapter should have 8-14 sections for comprehensive coverage
    - Introductions always begin the chapter
    - Each story should be immediately followed by its related topic explanation
    - Distribute bonus topics throughout to break up the content flow
    - Big box sections should provide technical depth on key AI concepts
    - Chapter summary should be followed by either a chapter bridge or outro
    - Chapter bridges should create logical transitions between chapters
    - The final chapter should end with an outro instead of a chapter bridge
    - All section titles should be specific and descriptive, not generic
    - Chapter titles should include a subtitle that captures the essence of the chapter

    Narrative Background: 
    - Two competing ridiculously competitive companies who don't even work in the same industry - Razorbeam and DriftLoaf - they're just in the same building. 
    - Razorbeam is run by a perfectionist but very forgetful female CEO and DriftLoaf is run by a laid back male CEO that fantasizes about running a chain of dispensaries. 
    - The employees spend more time planning and preparing for the extremely competitive sports, games, office pools, and yankee swaps and clandestine spy operations to gain advantages in these activities than they do in their real jobs. 
    - But once in awhile someone lands a new account, or sells something, or helps their team achieve something corporate-like.  
    - You get it. Let's teach AI Tools without making it boring.
    - Develop the stories, adventures and characters. 
    - Create a narrative arc that is engaging, fun, and interesting.

    Writing Style:
      - Use the style of Dan Hermes: lean, slightly casual, matter-of-fact, to-the-point, slightly poetic and humorous, with a touch of technical depth.
      - There are two co-authors who are secondary authors:
        - Tendy Bantner - a ChatGPT writer who was serious about his job when he was younger. He writes the funny stuff.
        - Marva Lenna - a ChatGPT writer who is a dedicated journalist, embarrassed to be working with Mr. Bantner, isn't sure about Hermes, but wants the reader to know she means business.
      - Use the comedic tension between the two authors to keep the narrative focused and serious but fun.
      - Tendy is the Muppet Show and Marva is Statler and Waldorf.
      - Interweave realistic anecdotes with facts and relevant AI Tooling.
      - Explain AI technical terms the first time they are used.

    A chapter is made up of sections of only these section types:


      Section Title              | Section Type
      -------------------------- | -------------------
      Introduction               | `intro`
      Story                      | `story`
      Topic Explanation          | `topic_explanation`
      Zero Intelligence          | `zero_intelligence`
      Bull Talk                  | `bull_talk`
      Bonus Topic                | `bonus_topic`
      Big Box                    | `big_box`
      Leaderboard                | `leaderboard`
      Chapter Summary            | `chapter_summary`
      Chapter Bridge             | `chapter_bridge`
      Outro (final chapter only) | `outro`

      DETAILS:

      Introduction:
      - Author: Marva
      - Purpose: Establish foundational concepts by connecting high-level AI-Enhancement principles with concrete examples, statistics, and business context. Identify key challenges and expert perspectives that frame the topic's importance.
      - Find simple themes, concepts, and ideas that can be used to bridge the higher level concepts with tangible demonstrative details, scenarios, and examples.
      - Find compelling and authoritative anecdotes, statistics or trends that highlight the importance of the topic
      - Seek directions which yield specific benefits in the employment of AI.
      - Research the broader business context and relevance
      - Identify key challenges or pain points in this area
      - Look for expert quotes that frame the topic effectively
      
      Story:
      - Author: Mostly Tendy with occasional Marva
      - Purpose: Demonstrate AI-Enhancement solutions through realistic fictional scenarios using 1-4 practical AI implementations (not just ChatGPT prompts). Show how employees would actually use AI tools in their daily work, with realistic capabilities and limitations clearly stated.
      - For story sections, you MUST include the required AI Tools that would be used to implement the solution described in the story.
      - Produce the AI Tools and GPT Prompts FIRST, before writing the story.
      - AI Tools:
        - AI Tools should help an employee with their work if they worked at the fictional company.
        - AI Tools must be usable by the employee to assist them in doing their everyday work.
        - AI Tools should demonstrate to the reader how to use AI to achieve results in their own work.
        - DO NOT EXAGGERATE OR ASCRIBE FALSE ABILITIES TO AI Tools! Clearly state when features are the result of AI Tools, and when they require a larger implementation
        - Explain when AI Tools will require additional uploaded documentation or data to achieve the desired result.
        - No magic buttons or hyperbolic statements or promises that AI Tools could not deliver on or more appropriate for an IT Implementation.
        - Larger implementations to move beyond AI Tools might include task automation using GPTs, OpenAI, RAG models, consulting, or other AI tools and solutions.
        - These AI Tools should be realistic, practical AI Tools that a business user would actually try and implement
      Also:
      - Research real-world tool use cases that can inspire fictional case studies grounded in practical AI adoption.
      - The purpose of the story is to bring AI tool usage into sharp focus through compelling narrative—focusing on how the tools are used, not screenshots, tutorials, or tool documentation.
      - Increase the complexity and integration of AI tools as the book progresses. Begin with a single, straightforward tool per story, then expand to tool combinations, workflows, or toolchains of two, three, or more tools working together.
      - Relate multiple tools and tool uses either cumulatively—where one enables the next—or in parallel—each solving a distinct part of a larger business or personal challenge.
      - Use these tool-based scenarios to illustrate progressive AI augmentation, leading to greater autonomy, decision-making power, or productivity at scale.
      - Define the setting with industry-specific details: company size, culture, team dynamics, key markets, known bottlenecks, and historical blockers.
      - Incorporate implementation context—how tools were adopted, piloted, or integrated; what teams led the charge; what friction arose; and how it was addressed.
      - Identify quantitative outcomes where possible: productivity gains, turnaround speed, conversion rates, hours saved, support deflected, new opportunities created.
      - Highlight obstacles and real-world limitations—missing integrations, learning curve, over-reliance, misalignment—and how the protagonists navigate or resolve them.

      - Here are examples of story templates. Use these and come up with your own like these:
        1. Fix the Problem - Begin the story with a challenge or problem that is compelling and specific. Spin an arc where the AI improves and resolves this challenge or problem. Land conclusively on a resolution.
        2. Create New Possibilities - Begin with a dearth of ideas and solutions. Spin an arc where the AI provides create new ideas and punches through the block. Resolve soundly using the AI direction.
        3. Connect the Dots - Begin with too much data and systems ouit of alignment. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws together data and systems into a useable, compelling solution. Land on a successful resolution.
        4. Catalyze People - Begin with a lack of human alignment, misunderstanding, and disengagement. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws people from different groups and needs together into action. Show their alignment together towards the same goals.
        5. Wrangle the Chaos - Begin with a disorganized mess of workflows, tasks, roles, and reports. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws these together into an organized, useful environment. End on harmony and productivity.
