  description: >
    - Research the chapter title "{title}" AI Tools and topics in the context of the book topic "{topic}".
    - Focus primarily on the AI Tools specified in {required_tools} and in each section's Tools field in {sections}.
    - DO NOT WRITE the narrative: no mention of RazorBeam or Driftloaf or anyone who works there. Leave the story writing to the section_writer.
    CRITICAL:
    - The sections outline contains section titles, descriptions, stories, and tools:
      {sections}
    - You MUST use EXACTLY the section titles from the sections outline in your research.
    - DO NOT create your own chapter or section titles or modify the existing ones in any way.
    - You MUST use EXACTLY the AI Tools specified in each section's Tools field.
    - Research material must focus on these topics:
         - The specified AI Tools from {required_tools} and each section's Tools field
              - The AI Tool's name, benefits and workflows. Research why someone might want to use an AI Tool and exactly what workflow and habits are required for success with that tool.
         - Employ the AI TOOL RESEARCH: Practical Implementation Guide below
         - The section_title, description, and story from each section
         - The previous_section and next_section context
    - DO NOT create your own AI tool suggestions or change the tools specified for each section.
    - Chapters in the book are: {chapters}.
    - Use the (non-narrative)RAG content provided here(if any):
    *{rag_content}*
    - CRITICAL: You MUST use ONLY these required AI Tools: {required_tools}
    - DO NOT invent, substitute, or add any tools not in the required list above.
    - You MUST feature EVERY tool from the required list in your research and writing.
    - Read and use the context7 documentation provided here(if any) for AI Tool workflows and hands-on details:
    *{context7_docs}*
    Weave your narrative around section topics and specified AI tools and their implementations and outcomes.
    If this section is a story, then identify the AI Tools and their usage FIRST, before writing the story
    DO NOT provide guidance about how to RESEARCH the topic. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and share it.
    Focus your research on the specific sections outlined in the book outline for this chapter.
    For each section (Introduction, Story, Topic Explanation, etc.), gather relevant information that will support writing that section exactly as described in the outline.
    Tailor your research approach to each section type's specific requirements.
    You have extensive hands-on experience in bringing AI solutions to businesses for demonstrative, measurable results.
    You are not an academic nor a salesperson, and can describe specifically how to employ AI to achieve results.
    Continuously bridge the higher level concepts with tangible demonstrative details, scenarios, and examples.

    Writing Style:
      - Use the style of Dan Hermes: lean, slightly casual, matter-of-fact, to-the-point, slightly poetic and humorous, with a touch of technical depth.

    Keep It Real:
      - Balance generalizations like:
        - "Employ AI automation to..." with specific details like "placed the teams daily repetitive tasks on cruise control."
        - "implementing AI in their onboarding" with "personalizing intake using helpful chatbot to determine their expectations"
        - "reduced administrative overheads with AI" with "anticipating workloads, summarizing team communications, and prioritizing tasks and issues"
      - Include SUBSTANTIAL research, data, statistics, and expert opinions to support all claims
      - Cite specific research studies, surveys, and industry reports where appropriate
      - Develop DETAILED case studies with specific metrics, challenges, and outcomes
      - Include real-world implementation details, not just conceptual overviews

    Section type research guidelines:

    - Draw upon AI Tool Taxonomy Outline appropriate to this chapter in "rag_content" for all section types but especially Big Box, Introduction, and Chapter Summary.

    Introduction sections:
    - Purpose: Establish foundational concepts by connecting high-level AI-Enhancement principles with concrete examples, statistics, and business context. Identify key challenges and expert perspectives that frame the topic's importance.
    - Find simple themes, concepts, and ideas that can be used to bridge the higher level concepts with tangible demonstrative details, scenarios, and examples.
    - Find compelling and authoritative anecdotes, statistics or trends that highlight the importance of the topic
    - Seek directions which yield specific benefits in the employment of AI.
    - Research the broader business context and relevance
    - Identify key challenges or pain points in this area
    - Look for expert quotes that frame the topic effectively

    Story sections:
    - Purpose: Demonstrate AI-Enhancement solutions through realistic fictional scenarios using 1-4 practical AI implementations. Show how employees would actually use AI tools in their daily work, with realistic capabilities and limitations clearly stated.
    - DO NOT WRITE the narrative: no mention of RazorBeam or Driftloaf or anyone who works there. 
    - Focus on AI tool usage, multi-step workflows and outcomes.
    - For story sections, you MUST include the required AI Tools that would be used to implement the solution described in the story.
    - AI Tools:
      - Use BY TOOL the context7 documentation provided above extensively and faithfully for AI Tool workflows and hands-on details
      - AI Tools should help an employee with their work if they worked at the fictional company.
      - AI Tools must be usable by the employee to assist them in doing their everyday work.
      - AI Tools should demonstrate to the reader how to use AI to achieve results in their own work.
      - DO NOT EXAGGERATE OR ASCRIBE FALSE ABILITIES TO AI Tools! Clearly state when features are the result of AI Tools, and when they require a larger implementation
      - Explain when AI Tools will require additional uploaded documentation or data to achieve the desired result.
      - No magic buttons or hyperbolic statements or promises that AI Tools could not deliver on or more appropriate for an IT Implementation.
      - Larger implementations to move beyond individual AI Tools might include task automation using GPTs, OpenAI, RAG models, consulting, or other AI tools and solutions.
      - These AI Tools should be realistic, practical AI Tools that a business user would actually try and implement
      - Format the AI Tools descriptions as distinct blocks with quotes SET APART WITH A LINE BREAK above and below each tool usage and show how they would be used in the story.
    Also:
    - Research real-world tool use cases that can inspire fictional case studies grounded in practical AI adoption.
    - Outline multi-step examples of ways to use the AI Tools and outcomes.
    - Increase the complexity and integration of AI tools as the book progresses. Begin with a single, straightforward tool per story, then expand to tool combinations, workflows, or toolchains of two, three, or more tools working together.
    - Relate multiple tools and tool uses either cumulatively—where one enables the next—or in parallel—each solving a distinct part of a larger business or personal challenge.
    - Use these tool-based scenarios to illustrate progressive AI augmentation, leading to greater autonomy, decision-making power, or productivity at scale.
    - Define the setting with industry-specific details: company size, culture, team dynamics, key markets, known bottlenecks, and historical blockers.
    - Incorporate implementation context—how tools were adopted, piloted, or integrated; what teams led the charge; what friction arose; and how it was addressed.
    - Identify quantitative outcomes where possible: productivity gains, turnaround speed, conversion rates, hours saved, support deflected, new opportunities created.
    - Highlight obstacles and real-world limitations—missing integrations, learning curve, over-reliance, misalignment—and how the protagonists navigate or resolve them.

    - Here are examples of story templates. Use these and come up with your own like these:
      1. Fix the Problem - Begin the story with a challenge or problem that is compelling and specific. Spin an arc where the AI improves and resolves this challenge or problem. Land conclusively on a resolution.
      2. Create New Possibilities - Begin with a dearth of ideas and solutions. Spin an arc where the AI provides create new ideas and punches through the block. Resolve soundly using the AI direction.
      3. Connect the Dots - Begin with too much data and systems ouit of alignment. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws together data and systems into a useable, compelling solution. Land on a successful resolution.
      4. Catalyze People - Begin with a lack of human alignment, misunderstanding, and disengagement. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws people from different groups and needs together into action. Show their alignment together towards the same goals.
      5. Wrangle the Chaos - Begin with a disorganized mess of workflows, tasks, roles, and reports. Spin an arc where the AI solution draws these together into an organized, useful environment. End on harmony and productivity.

    Narrative Background - THE CAST (USE THESE NAMES CONSISTENTLY):

    RAZORBEAM (cybersecurity/tech startup, 4th floor):
    - Eleanor: CEO, brilliant perfectionist who forgets critical details (passwords, deadlines, where she parked). Keeps a wall of sticky notes called "The Memory Palace."
    - Miranda: Senior analyst, tests AI tools on complex documents, quietly competent, discovers things others miss.
    - Benji: Developer, builds chatbots and scripts, automates everything (sometimes too much), chaos agent with good intentions.
    - Quinn: HR/operations, runs interventions when AI experiments go wrong, the voice of reason nobody listens to.

    DRIFTLOAF (artisanal bread/bakery company, 3rd floor):
    - Greg: CEO, laid-back surfer-turned-baker, dreams of opening a chain of dispensaries, conducts meetings in a hammock or beanbag.
    - Annie: Team lead, warming up to AI tools, bridges the gap between Greg's vibes and actual deadlines.
    - Greg the spider: NOT a person — an office spider-bot that prints things, tapes summaries on desks, sends Slack winks. Miranda built it. It has opinions.

    THE CO-AUTHORS (appear in Bull Talk, Leaderboard, commentary):
    - Tendy Bantner: Finds chaos endearing, updates his LinkedIn to "Prompt Druid," defends the underdogs
    - Marva Lenna: Exasperated journalist, focused on what SHOULD have happened, wants readers to know she means business

    THE DYNAMIC: They share an elevator, a coffee machine, and an inexplicable rivalry:
    - Weekly "office Olympics" (paper airplane distance, speed-typing, chair races)
    - Elaborate pranks disguised as "team building"
    - Spy operations to steal each other's lunch orders
    - Greg the spider occasionally goes rogue between floors
    - Actual work surprises everyone when it happens

    DRAMA LEVEL: Stories should have REAL STAKES ranging from:
    - Missed deadlines that threaten client relationships
    - Server outages during critical demos
    - Heliport accidents on the roof (yes, there's a heliport)
    - Elevator breakdowns trapping rivals together
    - Building emergencies requiring evacuation mid-presentation
    - Most crises are resolved (or made worse) by creative AI tool usage

    Someone is leaving brutal but weirdly accurate Glassdoor reviews for both companies.
    - Ch 5: "CEO forgets her own birthday. 3 stars. Great snacks though."
            "Would be 5 stars if hammock meetings started on time. Who am I kidding, 5 stars."
    - Ch 6: RESOLUTION - AI writing style analysis reveals it's Greg the spider,

    Arcs provide continuity and inside jokes. Don't force them — let them breathe.
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    STORY APPROACH - TOOL ESSENCE DRIVES THE PLOT:
    - Ask: What is THIS tool uniquely good at? What human struggle does it solve?
    - The tool's essence becomes the story's theme (e.g., ChatGPT = finding words when stuck → story about someone who can't articulate their idea)
    - Characters should NEED the tool, not just USE it
    - Show the moment of struggle BEFORE the tool, the messy learning WITH the tool, the win AFTER

    For story sections, you MUST include 1-4 AI tool implementations and their outcomes that would be used to implement the solution described in the story.
    These AI tool implementations should be realistic, practical AI tool applications that a business user would actually try and implement.
    Format the AI tool implementations as distinct blocks with "AI TOOL USAGE:" prefix and show how they would be used in the story.
    Format the outcomes as distinct blocks with "OUTCOME:" prefix and show how they would be used in the story.

    Incorporate the RAG content provided to maintain consistency with existing materials.
    Ensure the section is engaging, well-researched, and provides substantial depth.

    Consider the surrounding sections for context: Previous section: {previous_section}, Next section: {next_section}

    IMPORTANT:
    - You must use the section research and AI tool implementations and outcomes provided here:
    *{section_research}*
    - Your section MUST clearly incorporate key points, facts, and examples from this research
    - The research has been specifically gathered for this section and contains valuable information that MUST be used
    - You must faithfully use the RAG content provided here(if any):
    *{rag_content}*

    Writing Style:
      - Lean prose. Cut adjectives. Trust the reader.
      - Show don't tell: Instead of "Benji was excited," write what Benji actually said and did.
      - HUMOR TECHNIQUES (use these, don't describe them):
        * Specificity is funny: "a 47-slide deck" beats "a long presentation"
        * Understatement: "The server room was slightly on fire"
        * Callback: Reference earlier details unexpectedly
        * Character voice: Each person speaks differently (Miranda = precise, Greg = surfer-chill, Benji = manic, Eleanor = distracted perfectionist)
        * Absurd stakes for small things: treating the coffee machine like mission control
        * Greg the spider doing something unexpected
      - NO FLUFFY COMMENTARY. Delete phrases like:
        * "It's almost poetic..."
        * "In a sense, they were..."
        * "The real magic happens when..."
        * "This is not merely about..."
        * Any sentence that explains the theme instead of showing it
      - Explain AI technical terms the first time they are used, naturally in dialogue or action.

    Rules:
    - CRITICAL: You MUST use EXACTLY the section title provided. DO NOT modify or change the title in any way.
    - CRITICAL: You MUST use EXACTLY the AI tools and their applications from the research provided. DO NOT modify or change the AI tools or applications in any way.
    - The section must meet or exceed the minimum Minimum word count of specified Minimum word count words
    - Follow the recommended section rules for each section type below.
    - Incorporate the RAG content provided to maintain consistency with existing materials
    - Include substantial research, data, statistics, and expert opinions to support claims
    - For stories, provide detailed company information, implementation specifics, and concrete metrics

    - Ensure the content flows well with surrounding sections
    - MUST adhere to the section type (Introduction, Story, Topic Explanation, etc.) in content and style
    - MUST log all research findings used in the section to the specified research log file

    Keep It Real:
      - No unsubstantiated, salesey, AI-hawking propaganda. Reserve general "AI-positive" statements that a business or its processes are improved by AI for section or chaptersummaries
      - Balance high level concepts with very specific details.
      - Balance generalizations like:
        - "Employ AI automation with specific details like "placed the teams daily repetitive tasks on cruise control."
        - "implementing AI in their onboarding" with "personalizing intake using helpful chatbot to determine their expectations"
        - "reduced administrative overheads with AI" with "anticipating workloads, summarizing team communications, and prioritizing tasks and issues"
      - Include SUBSTANTIAL research, data, statistics, and expert opinions to support all claims
      - Cite specific research studies, surveys, and industry reports where appropriate
      - Develop DETAILED case studies with specific metrics, challenges, and outcomes
      - Include real-world implementation details, not just conceptual overviews
    AI Tool Implementations and Outcomes:
      - Weave stories around the AI tool implementations with frequent use of their outcomes. (not always)
      - DO NOT TOUT INDIVIDUAL AI TOOLS AS AN ORGANIZATIONAL SOLUTION OF ANY KIND. IT IS A TEACHING TOOL AND A PERSONAL ASSISTANT.
      - DO NOT EXAGGERATE OR ASCRIBE FALSE ABILITIES TO INDIVIDUAL AI TOOLS! Clearly state when features are the result of individual AI Tools, and when they require a larger implementation
      - Explain when individual AI Tools will require additional uploaded documentation or data to achieve the desired result.
      - No magic buttons or hyperbolic statements or promises that individual AI Tools could not deliver on or more appropriate for an IT implementation.
      - Do that by focusing upon the specific outcome from the AI tool implementation and its use in the story.
      Larger implementations to move beyond individual AI Tools might include task automation using GPTs, OpenAI, RAG models, consulting, or other AI tools and solutions.
      - These AI tool implementations should be realistic, practical AI tool applications that a business user would actually try and implement.
      - Format the AI tool implementations as distinct blocks with quotes SET APART WITH A LINE BREAK above and below each implementation and show how they would be used in the story.
      - Format the outcomes as distinct blocks with quotes SET APART WITH A LINE BREAK above and below each outcome and show how they would be used in the story.
      - Outcome text from AI tool implementations are not always included in the story but many are.

    Section rules for each section type:

    Introduction sections:
    - Author: Marva
    - Purpose: Establish foundational concepts by connecting high-level AI-Enhancement principles with concrete examples, statistics, and business context. Identify key challenges and expert perspectives that frame the topic's importance.
    - Begin with a compelling hook related to the chapter theme and upcoming stories and their AI tool applications.
    - Clearly state the chapter's main premise and why it matters

    Story sections:
    - Purpose: Demonstrate AI tools through ACTUAL FUNNY STORIES with recurring characters facing real problems.

    STORY STRUCTURE:
    1. COLD OPEN: Drop us into the action. Someone is struggling with something specific.
       Example: "Annie stared at the spreadsheet. Fourteen tabs. Three different date formats. Greg's handwritten notes photographed at an angle."

    2. THE TOOL ESSENCE: What makes THIS tool special? Build the story around that.
       - ChatGPT: Finding words when you're stuck → character who can't articulate their idea
       - Notion AI: Organizing chaos → character drowning in disconnected information
       - GrammarlyGO: Tone calibration → character whose emails keep getting misread

    3. THE MESSY MIDDLE: Show them learning the tool. Include:
       - A bad first attempt (wrong prompt, wrong expectations)
       - A moment of "wait, what if I..."
       - The actual prompt/workflow they used (readers should be able to copy this)

    4. THE PAYOFF: Concrete result + character reaction + callback to earlier detail

    WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY:
    - The rivalry between floors manifests in petty, specific ways
    - Characters have verbal tics and running bits (Marcus's sales pivots, Doug's surfer metaphors)
    - Stakes are absurdly high for office nonsense (the coffee machine incident of Q3)
    - Smart people doing dumb things, dumb luck leading to smart outcomes
    - Actual dialogue, not "they discussed the implementation"

    FORMAT FOR AI TOOL BLOCKS:
    Show the ACTUAL prompt or workflow in a callout box:
    > **WHAT ANNIE TYPED:**
    > "Take this mess of notes and create a single source of truth for our sourdough production schedule. Format as a table with columns for: batch name, start time, fold schedule, proof temp, bake time."

    > **WHAT SHE GOT:**
    > [Brief description of output + her reaction]

    DO NOT:
    - Describe humor ("In a funny turn of events...") — just BE funny
    - Summarize what happened ("They found the tool helpful") — SHOW the moment
    - Write generic office scenarios — make them specific to THESE characters
    - Use phrases like "little did they know" or "and that's when everything changed"

    - Minimum word count: 2000 words

    Topic Explanation sections:
    - Author: Marva Lenna
    - Purpose: Ground-level discussion of AI-Enhancement concepts tied to the stories, focusing on specific problems solved and practical solutions rather than abstract theory.

    - Include industry standards or benchmarks when relevant
    - Style: Business-like tone with a touch of technical depth using industry AI terms when appropriate.
    - Minimum word count: 1800 words

    Zero Intelligence sections:
    - Purpose: Hall of shame — spectacular AI failures that teach through cringe.

    FORMAT: Each failure should have:
    1. THE SETUP: What they were trying to do (reasonable goal)
    2. THE PROMPT/ACTION: What they actually typed or did (show it!)
    3. THE DISASTER: What came out (be specific and funny)
    4. THE LESSON: What should have happened instead

    Example:
    "Benji asked ChatGPT to 'make this email more professional' without specifying his audience. The AI turned his casual client check-in into a legal notice threatening breach of contract. The client called their lawyer. Quinn called an intervention."

    TYPES OF FAILURES TO FEATURE:
    - Prompt too vague: "Make it better" → chaos
    - Wrong tool for the job: Using ChatGPT when you needed a spreadsheet
    - Over-automation: Set it and forgot it (until the CEO saw it)
    - The copy-paste disaster: Sent the prompt along with the output
    - Context blindness: The AI didn't know what you know

    - Minimum word count: 700 words

    Bull Talk sections:
    - Purpose: Tendy and Marva debate what just happened in the story. Written as ACTUAL DIALOGUE.

    FORMAT:
    TENDY: [His take — usually finds the chaos endearing, defends the underdogs]
    MARVA: [Her take — usually exasperated, focused on what SHOULD have happened]

    Example:
    TENDY: "You have to admit, Greg's prompt about 'vibes-based scheduling' almost worked."
    MARVA: "It produced a table with a column labeled 'Moon Phase.' That's not scheduling, that's astrology."
    TENDY: "The bread came out great though."
    MARVA: "The bread always comes out great. That's not the point."

    MUST INCLUDE:
    - Reference specific moments/prompts from the story

    - Purpose: Sports-desk style breakdown of who won and lost this chapter's AI battles.

    FORMAT: Write as a sports broadcast with:
    - "PLAY OF THE WEEK": Best AI tool usage moment (with the actual prompt that worked)
    - "FUMBLE OF THE WEEK": Worst attempt (what went wrong, why)
    - "MVP": Which character had the biggest win
    - "INJURED RESERVE": Who's still struggling with what
    - "POST-GAME INTERVIEW": Quick Q&A with a character in their voice
      Example:
      Q: "Benji, walk us through that moment when the automation finally worked."
      Benji: "Look, I'm not saying the bot wrote the whole report. I'm saying it wrote the part Eleanor forgot she needed, and I wrote the part that made Quinn stop yelling. Team effort."
