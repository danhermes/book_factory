I messed tith outline_sections

        sections_text = "\n\n".join([
            f"Section {section.get('section_number', '')}: {section.get('section_title', '')}\n"
            f"Type: {section.get('type', '')}\n"
            f"Content: {section.get('content', '')}"
            for section in chapter_data.get("sections", [])
        ])

        result = crew.kickoff(inputs={
            "title": chapter_title,
            "topic": book_topic,
            "chapters": [chapter["title"] for chapter in chapters],
            "sections": sections_text
        })

        # result = crew.kickoff(inputs={
        #     "title": chapter_title,
        #     "topic": book_topic,
        #     "chapters": [chapter["title"] for chapter in chapters],
        #     "outline_sections": [section.get("section_title", "") for section in chapter_data.get("sections", [])]
        # })

ChatGPT: To ensure that PROMPT: and RESPONSE: blocks are visually preserved and wrapped correctly in the final PDF, you should wrap them in code block fences (```) in the Markdown before passing it to Pandoc.

Use BookModel.title

# Every Chapter.md:
   ## Chapter 1: Unknown Chapter 
   # Unknown Chapter

#Load Book data from file instead of hard code:
class BookState(BaseModel):
    topic: str = "ChatGPT prompts for use by the businsessperson"
    book_title: str = "ChatGPT for the Office"
    total_chapters: int = 7
    titles: list[str] = []
    chapters: list[Chapter] = []

#Use Classes instead of hard-coding
"topic": "ChatGPT for Business",
