Domain Model First: Always prioritize using the established domain models (like BookState) as the primary data structures throughout the codebase. Never create parallel or alternative data structures that bypass the domain model.

Model-Aligned Serialization: When serializing domain models, always use the model's built-in serialization methods (.dict() or .model_dump() for Pydantic) rather than creating custom dictionaries.

Architectural Continuity: Every technical solution must maintain continuity with the architectural vision. Before implementing any fix, explicitly verify: "Does this solution maintain or strengthen the established architecture?"

Implementation Hierarchy: When solving problems, follow this hierarchy:

First: Solutions that leverage existing domain models
Second: Solutions that extend domain models
Last Resort: Solutions that work around domain models (and only with explicit justification)
Explicit Architecture Validation: After implementing any solution, validate and document how it aligns with the architectural principles.
